- **Date Selector**: 
  - Defaults to today
  - Opens iOS/Android native calendar picker
  - Restricts dates to next 90 days

  - Grid layout with 3 columns
  - Selected time slot highlights in primary color
- **Actions**:

  - Schedule button (enabled only when time slot selected)
  - Confirmation dialog after scheduling

## UI Design
- Modern Material Design with rounded corners
- Google Fonts (Poppins) for consistent typography
- Responsive layout that adapts to screen size
- Color scheme matches app theme
- Calendar icon (Material Icons) in primary color

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any cat detail screen
2. Look for the calendar icon in the toolbar (appears FIRST, before all other tools)
3. Tap the calendar icon
4. Select a date from the dropdown
5. Choose an available time slot
6. Tap "Schedule" to confirm
7. Confirmation dialog appears

## Toolbar Button Order
The toolbar now displays buttons in this order:
1. **üìÖ Schedule** (Only if email available - needed for scheduling)
2. üìû Phone (if available)
3. ‚úâÔ∏è Email (if available)
4. üó∫Ô∏è Map (if valid address)
5. üì§ Share (if shelter data available)

**Note:** 
- The "Meet" button has been removed
- Schedule button requires email to be available since scheduling requires communication with the organization

## TODO (Backend Integration)
- [ ] Connect to organization's actual calendar system
- [ ] Fetch real availability from backend
- [ ] Send appointment request to shelter
- [ ] Email confirmation to user
- [ ] Add to user's calendar
- [ ] Handle time zones
- [ ] Add recurring availability patterns
- [ ] Shelter admin approval workflow

## Testing
To test the UI:
1. Run the app
2. Navigate to any pet detail screen
3. Tap the calendar icon in the toolbar
4. Play with date selection and time slots
5. Complete the scheduling flow

## Notes
- Currently shows sample time slots (no backend integration)
- Time slots change based on weekday vs weekend
- All data is mock/demo data for UI testing
- Schedule button shows confirmation dialog but doesn't persist data
