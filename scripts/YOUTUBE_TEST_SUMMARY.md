# YouTube Video Test Summary

## Test Results

**Date:** Generated by test script
**Total Breeds Tested:** 65

### cats101URL Field (Primary - Used in App)
- **Playable:** 63 out of 65 (97% success rate) ✅
- **Invalid:** 1-2 videos need attention
- **Status:** Excellent - This is the field actually displayed on breed detail screens

### youTubeURL Field (Secondary)
- **Playable:** ~23 out of 65
- **Invalid:** ~42 videos (many 404 errors)
- **Status:** Many outdated video IDs - Consider updating or removing

## Key Finding

The app uses `widget.breed.cats101URL` for displaying videos (see `breedDetail.dart` line 769), and **97% of these videos are playable**. This is excellent!

The `youTubeURL` field has many outdated IDs but is not directly used for video display in the current implementation.

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **cats101URL is working well** - Only 1-2 videos need fixing
2. ⚠️ **youTubeURL has outdated IDs** - Consider updating or removing if not needed
3. ✅ **Overall video functionality is good** - 97% success rate on the field actually used

## Running the Test

```bash
cd feline_finder
python3 scripts/test_youtube_videos.py
```

The script will:
- Parse all breeds from `lib/models/breed.dart`
- Check both youTubeURL and cats101URL fields
- Report which videos are playable and which have errors
- Provide a detailed error list for fixing
